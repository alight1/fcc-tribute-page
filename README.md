# fcc-tribute-page
freeCodeCamp project: [Build a Tribute Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page)

A responsive web page with the [Readmore.js library](https://github.com/jedfoster/Readmore.js) for expand/collapse functionality. I created it with the following concepts:

* CSS variables and functions
* display: flex and grid
* Responsive images and iframes for embedded video
* Accessibility
* Media queries for enhanced responsiveness
* NPM + Webpack to automate build and publish process
