            <p>Pitchfork Media wrote of his first album, <em>Englabörn</em> (released in <time datetime="2002">2002</time>):</p>
            <blockquote>"[it's] exceptionally restrained, the piano moving like droplets off of slowly melting
                icicles, the violin breathing warmth from above. The hesitation of each breath and falling bead feels as
                though it were a Morton Feldman piece condensed to three minutes."</blockquote>
